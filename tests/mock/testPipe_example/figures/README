For plotting consider the following tools:
- in R: 
    - plotly (https://github.com/ropensci/plotly)
- in Python: 
    - mpld3 (http://mpld3.github.io/quickstart.html)

D3 seems to be a great general tool and could also be used in R:
see example http://vis.supstat.com/2012/11/contour-plots-with-d3-and-r/
